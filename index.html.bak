						<h2>Change Management</h2>
						<p>
						I see change management as the sum of all activities that target the definition and implementation of a specific development in the organization.
						People, markets, strategies, structures, cultures, processes, or even technologies – all can be the focus of change. But, in the end, it always 
						involves the people in the organization.
						</p>
						<p>Changes cannot, however, be dictated – they need to be negotiated. It is a matter of combining different perspectives and objectives. 
							That is why I work discursively across all business areas. Which is not to say that everyone should be involved in every decision. 
							Who can contribute to a solution? Who will implement it? I will find the right persons and engage them in a structured dialog.
